Game AI 
==========================================

Game AI is a course offered by CS department at the Univesirty of Bonn, there are three projects in this course where we discuss in details some methods for Game AI that are widely used. First, we provide a brief demonstration about these methods. Some probabilistic and heuristic agents were implemented to play TicTacToe and Connect Four games. Then we explain strategies for turn based games and present methods for path planning and behavioural programming.

For more details about these projects please read my final report, all the solutions of these projects are implemented in Python, to get the source code please contact me by email (below).
